  National Gugak
  Center (henceforth NGC)</a> has orchestrated a variety of
  projects worldwide to encourage and develop new compositions for
  contemporary gugak. Since 1941, we have been offering an organized
  list of contemporary gugak pieces to the public.

  <br><p>We also established a strong foothold in music composition
  through the Contemporary Gugak Orchestra.</p>
  Currently, there are specific ongoing projects designed to
  attract people’s attention to traditional Korean music composition. First,
  after producing digital music files of traditional Korean instruments, we
  provide a service to easily access the sources online for both the public
  and the composers of various genres.
  <p>Second, NGC holds a composition contest in association with Grofolio,
    a Naver Online Creative contest.</p>
